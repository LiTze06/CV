    <h2>Project</h2>
    <h3>Innovent your Business' Design Challenge March 2016 - April 2016</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I was involved in a group of 5 people where all of us come from different fields, such as accounting, marketing, information
        technology, and management.</li>
      <li>Worked on a business design challenge together with Stefan Preston and Bachcare to identify a business design that
        would develop an “experimental accommodation” category where the accommodation itself is the destination. </li>
      <li>Used tools such as empathy interviews and value mapping to identify latent needs and behaviour where our target audiences
        were backpackers. </li>
      <li>Presented several ideas to fulfil the latent needs and listened to others opinions during team discussion.</li>
      <li>Prototyped a business design that would attract backpackers. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Idea Challenge & Context Summary March 2016 - June 2016 </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I was involved in a team of five where we develop an idea that addresses the challenge of entrepreneurship education
        and training for NZ students (years 1 – 13). </li>
      <li>We came out with EntreStory, an educational app created for students from years 9 to 13 that aimed to foster children
